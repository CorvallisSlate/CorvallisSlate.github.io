# Climate Crisis & Community Resilience
Our City has consistently deprioritized and underfunded climate action. As young people, we know that we don’t have time to wait. We need city councilors that understand climate science and climate policy and are willing to act boldly in the face of industry opposition. If elected to city council, we will:
  - Ensure that the City Manager hires a climate program specialist, a position that has been left vacant for over a year. Support the Climate Action Advisory Board to meet and take their recommendations seriously. 

  - Restrict the expansion of so-called “natural” gas infrastructure in the city, with the end goal of fully electrifying and decarbonizing our grid. Design a Just Transition that supports renters and low-income people transitioning away from fossil fuel systems.

  - Prioritize active and public transportation in all infrastructure decisions. We must actually implement the City’s Transportation Action Plan - and build the neighborhood bikeways now, not ten years from now!
  
  - Eliminating organic waste in the landfills by passing the No Wasted Food ordinance, which will require restaurants and grocery stores to compost food waste.
  
  - Bring back and pass the Home Energy Score, a low-hanging-fruit climate action that should have passed the first time.


We must build community resilience for climate change and natural disasters by prioritizing the implementation of our City’s emergency management plan, and by supporting community efforts to build grassroots climate resilience. 
  - Our City has an excellent emergency management plan, but it is not currently being prioritized for implementation. We have seen climate disasters becoming more and more frequent in our communities, and we know that the time is now to begin planning for what is to come.
  
  - Climate resilience planning must always consider and prioritize our most vulnerable residents, including tenants, housing insecure and unhoused residents, low-income residents, disabled and elderly residents, BIPOC residents, and students. 
  
  - We must work towards linguistic and physical accessibility in all disaster management contexts. 
  
  - Local organizations and grassroots groups are already working hard to build community resilience. As city government, we must work with not against these groups. 

# Safe and affordable housing
As tenants, we know our housing system is not set up for affordability, or even livability. We will fight for tenants rights and for policies that increase our affordable housing supply. 
  - We support the passage of a [Renter's Bill of Rights](https://create.umn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Renters-Bill-of-Rights.pdf), a suite of legal mechanisms that protect renters from landlord exploitation. These laws work to affirm the rights of renters against health hazards, harassment, and displacement. 
  
  - Explore a vacant property tax, which would increase rental supply by encouraging property owners to lease vacant properties.
  
  - Partner with local advocacy groups to provide ongoing Tenant’s Rights education, ensuring renters are equipped with the knowledge and resources to protect themselves against unfair housing practices.

# Housing Justice 
We must end the inhumane treatment of unhoused people by the City government and work with service providers to find real, long-term solutions that build stability for those of us impacted by the housing crisis. In light of the recent Johnson vs. Grants Pass Supreme Court decision, that makes it legal for cities to punish unhoused people for sleeping in public spaces, it is more important than ever to have people on council that will stand up for our neighbors without homes. If elected to Council we will:
  - Stop the forced evictions (sweeps) of unhoused folks living on public land. Studies have repeatedly shown that sweeps do nothing to reduce homelessness, and instead perpetuate the cycle of poverty by making people’s lives more unstable, more miserable, and more expensive. Sweeps are cruel, counterproductive, and a waste of public money.
    - Step one is to implement a rolling moratorium on sweeps, which would allow for temporary predictability and support for folks living outside.
    - After that, we must work with service providers to find real, long-term solutions that build stability and safety.
  
  - Uplift organizations in the community providing warming and cooling centers during extreme weather or air quality events. 
  
  - Support organizations in the community providing basic needs and harm reduction.
  
  - Maintain public bathrooms and drinking fountains throughout the year and in all weather conditions.

# Transparency and public input 
Our city government has lost a lot of public trust, and rightfully so. There have been far too many transparency issues for us to know what is really going on. We intend to engage openly with the public and hold our government accountable to its mistakes.
  - The City Council is an elected body accountable to the people. It should be in charge of the City Manager, not the other way around! 
  
  - Advisory Boards should be respected, staffed, supported, and have a meaningful impact on Council decisions. 
  
  - We must end the [unjust attack on Councilor Charlyn Ellis](https://democratherald.com/news/local/government-politics/corvallis-files-for-summary-judgment/article_69b2c9da-eae6-11ee-b55f-ff1eafb53e38.html) and update the city charter to clarify its meaning. No more money spent on legal fees or lawsuit defense when the case could be ended at any time by Council.
  
  - Lead a city transition from Franchise Agreements to Licensing Ordinances across all franchise utilities. This will allow the City to protect its authority over the public domain, and advance the priorities of our residents, rather than that of private utilities. 

# Safe Streets 
Far too many of our friends and neighbors have been hit or endangered by cars while walking or biking in Corvallis. We will work to make our streets safer for all by prioritizing accessible walking, rolling, and public transportation in all our decisions. 

  - Adopt evidence-based street and intersection designs that prioritize safety.
  
  - Actually implement our City’s Transportation Action Plan - and build the neighborhood bikeways now, not ten years from now!
  
  - Create a Car Free Monroe Avenue with exceptions for ADA and delivery vehicles. This proposal is widely popular among both business owners and customers on Monroe, and would allow for a vibrant and walkable economic hub in the heart of Corvallis. 
  
  - Reduce car traffic on 1st and 2nd street to continue making room for outdoor seating and walkability.
